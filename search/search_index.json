'One of the most influential writers of the 20th century, Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was born into a German-speaking Jewish merchant family in Prague. He worked as a clerk for the rest of his life, writing his literary works outside work, mostly at night. The impersonal nature of the office, the human helplessness and the sense of alienation that resulted from his multiple outsides, provided the basic experience of his art. The overwhelming weight of his abusive father's authority, the experience of loneliness and anxiety, are the dominant themes of his work. Few of his works were published during his lifetime, and he allowed them to be published at the encouragement of his friends. Before his death, he asked his lover and his best friend to destroy his manuscripts (some researchers estimate that he himself burned about ninety percent of Kafka's writings), but only one of them did so. The friend, Max Brod, published the texts he had, saving for posterity several of Kafka's works that are now considered crucial, including two of his best-known fragments, The Trial and The Castle.'</li> <li> <p>Query: Summarize the article.</p> </li> <li> <p>Questions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Franz Kafka n\u00e9met nyelv\u0171 pr\u00e1gai zsid\u00f3 csal\u00e1dban sz\u00fcletett?

Of the substrates, after fixation, the activated carbon granules clumped together in the column reactor and moved up the column in a plug-like fashion, making hydrogen sulphide elimination impossible, so I excluded activated carbon from further measurements. The alginate bead substrate, despite condensation of the escaping gas humidity, lost its water content and thus its elasticity and high specific surface area, and in parallel the substrate collapsed under its own weight. For this reason, alginate beads were not used as carriers in further experiments.'</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Modules/#world-knowledge","title":"World knowledge","text":"<p>This module evaluates the model's grasp of factual information across a wide range of topics.
